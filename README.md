# Building Your First MVP with GitHub Copilot

_Empower Product Managers to build functional MVPs and prototypes using AI-powered development - no coding background required!_

## Welcome to AI-Powered Product Management üöÄ

- **Who is this for**: Product Managers, Entrepreneurs, Business Analysts, and anyone who wants to prototype products without waiting for developers.
- **What you'll learn**: How to use GitHub Copilot to build, test, and iterate on MVPs using natural language instructions.
- **What you'll build**: A complete web application MVP for managing student activities - from concept to working prototype.
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Product management mindset and curiosity about user problems
  - Understanding of basic web applications (what users see and do)
  - **No programming experience needed** - AI handles the technical implementation!
- **How long**: 90 minutes to build your first working MVP

## Why This Matters for Product Managers

Traditional product development often creates a gap between product vision and technical implementation. This exercise shows you how to:

- **Bridge the PM-Engineering Gap**: Understand how your product requirements translate into working software
- **Prototype Rapidly**: Turn product ideas into working demos in minutes, not weeks
- **Validate Faster**: Test user flows and gather feedback with real, functional prototypes
- **Communicate Better**: Speak more effectively with engineering teams by understanding implementation

## What You'll Learn

1. **Product Discovery with AI**: Use AI to analyze existing applications and identify opportunities
2. **Requirement Translation**: Convert user stories and business needs into working features
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Build new functionality by describing what you want in natural language
4. **User Testing**: Deploy and test your MVP with real users
5. **Iteration Workflows**: Make product improvements based on feedback using AI assistance

## Your Product Management Journey

### üéØ **Step 1: Product Discovery & Setup**
Set up your AI-powered development environment and analyze your first MVP candidate - a student activities management system. Learn how AI can help you understand existing products and identify improvement opportunities.

### üîç **Step 2: User Experience Analysis** 
Use AI to identify critical UX issues and implement fixes. Learn how to translate user problems into technical solutions without writing code yourself.

### üöÄ **Step 3: Feature Development**
Build a major new feature (participant visibility) by describing your requirements in product language. Experience how AI can implement multi-file changes across frontend and backend systems.

### üìã **Step 4: MVP Launch & Release Management**
Prepare your MVP for launch using AI-powered release documentation, product reviews, and stakeholder communication tools.

### üéâ **Bonus: Advanced AI Features**
Explore Agent Mode for complex multi-step product development tasks like database migrations and advanced functionality.

## Real-World Product Manager Skills

This exercise teaches you practical skills you'll use daily:

- **Competitive Analysis**: Use AI to quickly understand how existing products work
- **User Story Implementation**: Turn business requirements into working features
- **Cross-Functional Communication**: Better collaborate with engineering teams
- **MVP Validation**: Build and test hypotheses with real, functional prototypes
- **Technical Feasibility**: Assess what's possible and how long things might take
- **Release Management**: Ship features using proper product development workflows

## The Student Activities MVP

You'll work with a real web application that helps high school students discover and register for extracurricular activities. This MVP includes:

- **User Registration**: Students can sign up for activities with email validation
- **Activity Discovery**: Browse available activities with descriptions and schedules  
- **Capacity Management**: Track participant limits and availability
- **Social Features**: See who else is participating to make informed decisions

Perfect for learning product management concepts like user flows, data validation, social proof, and MVP feature prioritization!

### How to start this exercise

Ready to build your first MVP? Simply copy the exercise to your account, then give our AI assistant **about 20 seconds** to prepare your first product management lesson, then **refresh the page**.

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.
   
If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
