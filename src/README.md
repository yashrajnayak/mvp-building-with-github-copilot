# Student Activities Management MVP

A real-world web application built for Product Managers to learn rapid prototyping and MVP development with AI. This application demonstrates how PMs can build functional products without deep technical expertise.

## Product Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Users
- **Primary**: High school students looking to discover and join extracurricular activities
- **Secondary**: School administrators managing activity offerings and capacity
- **Learning Goal**: Product Managers understanding user-centered application design

### ðŸ’¡ Core Value Proposition
- **Simplified Discovery**: Easy browsing of all available activities with clear descriptions
- **Social Validation**: See who else is participating to make informed decisions
- **Friction-Free Registration**: Quick sign-up process with email validation
- **Transparency**: Real-time capacity tracking and availability visibility

## Current MVP Features

### âœ… **Activity Discovery & Browsing**
- **User Story**: *"As a student, I want to see all available activities so I can explore my options"*
- **Implementation**: Clean activity cards with descriptions, schedules, and capacity info
- **Product Value**: Reduces decision paralysis by presenting information clearly

### âœ… **Smart Registration System**  
- **User Story**: *"As a student, I want to register for activities without confusion or errors"*
- **Implementation**: One-click registration with email validation and duplicate prevention
- **Product Value**: Eliminates user frustration and data quality issues

### âœ… **Social Proof & Transparency**
- **User Story**: *"As a student, I want to see who else is signed up so I can join activities with friends"*
- **Implementation**: Participant visibility with clean list formatting
- **Product Value**: Increases engagement through social validation

### âœ… **Capacity Management**
- **User Story**: *"As a student, I want to know if spots are available before trying to register"*
- **Implementation**: Real-time availability tracking with "spots remaining" display
- **Product Value**: Sets proper expectations and prevents disappointment

## Product Management Learning Objectives

This MVP teaches essential PM skills:

1. **User-Centered Design**: Features solve real user problems
2. **Data Validation**: Prevent bad user experiences with smart validation
3. **Social Features**: Leverage psychology to increase engagement
4. **Transparency**: Build trust through clear information architecture
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Design for growth from day one

## Technical Architecture (For PM Understanding)

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript - what users see and interact with
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI - business logic and data management  
- **Data Storage**: In-memory (perfect for MVP testing, easily upgraded)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for clean separation of concerns

### Why This Tech Stack for PMs?
- **Fast Prototyping**: Get from idea to working demo quickly
- **Easy to Understand**: Clear separation between user interface and business logic
- **AI-Friendly**: GitHub Copilot excels at these technologies
- **Production-Ready**: Can scale to real users when validated

## Product Manager Quick Start Guide

### ðŸš€ **"I've Never Built Software Before"**

Perfect! This exercise is designed for you. Here's all you need to know:

1. **Use GitHub Codespaces** - A complete development environment in your browser
2. **Talk to AI in Plain English** - Describe what you want, AI builds it
3. **Test Like a User** - Click through your app to validate features work
4. **Think Product-First** - Focus on user problems, not technical details

### ðŸ“‹ **Development Workflow for PMs**

```
1. Identify User Problem â†’ 2. Describe Solution to AI â†’ 3. Test with Users â†’ 4. Iterate
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Product Decisions in This MVP**

- **Email-Based Identity**: Simple user identification without complex authentication
- **Activity-Centric Design**: Focus on browsing and discovery over user profiles  
- **Social Proof Strategy**: Show participants to increase engagement
- **Capacity Limits**: Create urgency and manage expectations
- **Single-Page Application**: Minimize cognitive load for users

## API Endpoints (For PM Understanding)

| Endpoint | What It Does | When Users See It |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| `GET /activities` | Fetch all activities | Page loads, real-time updates |
| `POST /activities/{name}/signup` | Register for activity | User clicks "Sign Up" |

## Data Model (Product Perspective)

### Activities
- **Business Logic**: Each activity has capacity limits and social proof
- **User Impact**: Students see availability and can make informed decisions
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new activities without code changes

### Student Registration
- **Validation**: Email format + duplicate prevention
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback on success/failure
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection (just email for MVP)

## Product Analytics Opportunities

*Future enhancements you could track:*

- **Discovery Metrics**: Which activities are viewed most?
- **Conversion Rates**: Browse â†’ Register funnel analysis
- **Social Proof Impact**: Do activities with participants get more sign-ups?
- **Capacity Optimization**: Are limits set correctly for demand?
